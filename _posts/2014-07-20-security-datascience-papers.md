Over the past several years I have collected and read many security research papers/slides and have started a small catalog of sorts.  The topics of these papers range from intrusion detection, anomaly detection, machine learning/data mining, internet scale data collection, malware analysis, and intrusion reports.  I figured this collection may be useful to others so here it is.  I hope to clean this up when I get some more time as well as adding some detailed notes I have on the various features, models, algorithms, and datasets used in many of these papers.
