* [You Are What You Do: Hunting Stealthy Malware via Data Provenance Analysis](https://whassan3.web.engr.illinois.edu/papers/provdetector-NDSS2020.pdf) 
* [NODOZE: Combatting Threat Alert Fatigue with Automated Provenance Triage](https://whassan3.web.engr.illinois.edu/papers/NoDoze-NDSS2019.pdf) 
* [Transparent Web Service Auditing via Network Provenance Functions](https://adambates.org/documents/Bates_Www17.pdf) 
* [OmegaLog: High-Fidelity Attack Investigation via Transparent Multi-layer Log Analysis](https://whassan3.web.engr.illinois.edu/papers/omegalog-NDSS2020.pdf)
