My name is Jason Trost. I am a developer and security researcher deeply interested in Big Data/cloud computing and machine Learning.  I have a few years experience using Hadoop and Mapreduce to process and analyze computer network and security data.  I also have experience developing applications with [Apache Accumulo](http://incubator.apache.org/accumulo/) and [Backtype's Storm](https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm).  I like Java and python, as well as UNIX shell scripting.  This blog is going to cover topics ranging from processing data with Hadoop and MapReduce to applied machine learning techniques to interesting hacking and computer network defense tools I encounter.  I am always open to requests for blog posts...

Feel free to follow me on Twitter and/or Github.
