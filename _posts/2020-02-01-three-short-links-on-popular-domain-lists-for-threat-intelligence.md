A short listing of research papers I've read that analyze popular domain lists.  These papers analyze Alexa, Quantcast, Cisco Umbrella, and Majestic top websites/domains.

* [A Long Way to the Top: Significance, Structure, and Stability of Internet Top Lists](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11506.pdf)
* [Rigging Research Results by Manipulating Top Websites Rankings](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0047/4a718cac85d240f605acdffe396046be0ac0.pdf)
* [TRANCO: A Research-Oriented Top Sites Ranking Hardened Against Manipulation](https://tranco-list.eu/assets/tranco-ndss19.pdf)

The "short links" format was inspired by [Oreilly's Four Short Links](https://www.oreilly.com/feed/four-short-links) series.
