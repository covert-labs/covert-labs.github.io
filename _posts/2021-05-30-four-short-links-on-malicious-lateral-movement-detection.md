In this short blog, I share four papers that focus on detecting malicious lateral movement (a.k.a. pivoting, a.k.a. island hopping).

**Papers:**

* [Latte: Large-Scale Lateral Movement Detection ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/03/Milcom2018_Liu.pdf)
* [Detection and Threat Prioritization of Pivoting Attacks in Large Networks](https://iris.unimore.it/retrieve/handle/11380/1149159/349875/Detection%20and%20Threat.pdf)
* [Towards an Efficient Detection of Pivoting Activity](http://dl.ifip.org/db/conf/im/im2021-ws4-grasec/213223.pdf)
* [A Machine Learning Approach for RDP-based Lateral Movement Detection](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/handle/10012/15074/Bai_Zhenyu.pdf?sequence=3)

Lastly, if you're interested in discovering more interesting papers like these, use the method I outlined [here](/security-data-science-learning-resources/).

The "short links" format was inspired by [O'Reilly's Four Short Links](https://www.oreilly.com/feed/four-short-links) series.
