This was a great [series](http://hortonworks.com/blog/big-data-security-part-one-introducing-packetpig/) [of](http://hortonworks.com/blog/big-data-security-part-two-introduction-to-packetpig/) [articles](http://hortonworks.com/blog/packetpig-finding-zero-day-attacks/) from the guys at [Packetloop](https://www.packetloop.com/) on using [PacketPig](https://github.com/packetloop/packetpig) for large scale pcap analysis including offline intrusion detection using Snort over TBs of pcaps and  security analytics.
