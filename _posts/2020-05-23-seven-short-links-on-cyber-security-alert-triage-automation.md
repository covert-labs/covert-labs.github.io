A short listing of research papers I've discovered recently that aim to automate or speed up cyber security alert triage (alert prioritization/ranking, causal event correlation, and enrichment).  

* [NODOZE: Combatting Threat Alert Fatigue with Automated Provenance Triage](https://kangkookjee.github.io/publications/nodoze-ndss2019.pdf) 
* [OmegaLog: High-Fidelity Attack Investigation via Transparent Multi-layer Log Analysis](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/24270-paper.pdf) 
* [Towards a Timely Causality Analysis for Enterprise Security](http://www.princeton.edu/~pmittal/publications/priotracker-ndss18.pdf)
* [ProPatrol: Attack Investigation via Extracted High-Level Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.05711.pdf) 
* [Exploiting Time and Subject Locality for Fast, Efficient, and Understandable Alert Triage](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1505905) 
* [Deep learning for prioritizing and responding to intrusion detection alerts](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8170757) 
* [Automated Threat-Alert Screening for Battling Alert Fatigue with Temporal Isolation Forest](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8949029)
