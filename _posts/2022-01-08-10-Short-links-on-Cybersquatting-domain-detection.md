In this short blog, I share 3 papers and 7 tools that focus on detecting cyber squatting domains (including typosquating, homograph, combosquatting, etc.).

* [Detection of Cybersquatted Domains (Master’s Thesis)](http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/masters/Fris21a.pdf) by Patrick Frischknecht
* [Hiding in plain sight: A longitudinal study of combosquatting abuse](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.08519.pdf)
* [Seven months’ worth of mistakes: A longitudinal study of typosquatting abuse](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/01_3_1.pdf)

Tools for generating cybersquatting domains (for use in detection)

* https://github.com/elceef/dnstwist
* https://github.com/atenreiro/opensquat
* http://www.morningstarsecurity.com/research/urlcrazy
* https://github.com/phar/eyephish
* https://github.com/SquatPhish/2-Distributed-Crawler
* https://github.com/SquatPhish/3-Phish-Page-Detection
* https://github.com/SquatPhish/4-Evasion-Obfuscation-Analysis

Lots of other tools/libraries now exist if you need an implementation in a different language. See these github tags for lots more tools: [typosquatting](https://github.com/topics/typosquatting), [homoglyph](https://github.com/topics/homoglyph), and [homograph-attack](https://github.com/topics/homograph-attack).

The "short links" format was inspired by [O'Reilly's Four Short Links](https://www.oreilly.com/feed/four-short-links) series.
