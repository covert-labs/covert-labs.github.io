**Update (1/1/2017)**: I will not be updating this page and instead will make all updates to this page: [The Definitive Security Data Science and Machine Learning Guide](/the-definitive-security-datascience-and-machinelearning-guide/) (see [Deep Learning and Security Papers](/the-definitive-security-datascience-and-machinelearning-guide/#deep-learning-and-security-papers) section).

This is another quick post.  Over the past few months I started researching [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) to determine if it may be useful for solving security problems.  This post on [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) was what got me interested in this topic, and I highly recommend reading it in its entirety.  

Throughout this research, I came across several security related academic and professional research papers on security topics that use Deep Learning as part of their research.  What follows is a list of the papers/slides/videos that I found, and these may be useful to others.  If you have others that you think should be added to this list, please ping me: [@jason_trost](https://twitter.com/jason_trost).
